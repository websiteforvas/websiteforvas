      I am a virtual assistant who has been working behind the scenes for the
      past 9 years. I work with coaches, internet marketers, speakers etc. to
      help them build their businesses. I free up their time so that they can do
      what they do best, while I do what I do best, which is ensuring the back
      end of their business runs smoothly and efficiently. I love strategizing
      with my clients and showing them how to rock their businesses to the core!
      I am always ready for new challenges and meet them head-on.

    The title meta tag is the most important element in the site optimization
    process. Many search engines pay particular attention to keywords that occur
    in the title tag. As well, search engines generally display the title tag's
    contents in their site listings.
  e_description: >-
    The description meta tag defines site information a search engine displays
    when it lists the site. The description meta tag should concisely explain
