Academic is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without appropriate backing. You can support Academic development via the following methods: 

- [Donate a coffee](https://paypal.me/cushen)
- [Become a backer on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cushen)
- [Decorate your laptop or journal with an Academic sticker](https://www.redbubble.com/people/neutreno/works/34387919-academic)
- [Wear the T-shirt](https://academic.threadless.com/)
- Spread the word - Tweet/blog/vlog about your Academic experience
- Assist on Github by regularly responding to issues, reviewing code, and submitting pull requests
